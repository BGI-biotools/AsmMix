# AsmMix

AsmMix, which is capable of producing both contiguous and accurate diploid genomes. It first assembles co-barcoded reads to generate accurate haplotype-resolved assemblies that may contain many gaps, while the long-read assembly is contiguous but susceptible to errors. Then those two sets of sequences are compared and integrated into a haplotype-resolved assembly with reduced errors. 

[AsmMix](https://github.com/BGI-biotools/AsmMix/tree/main/AsmMix) are AsmMix pipeline itself and [Evaluation](https://github.com/BGI-biotools/AsmMix/tree/main/Evaluation) are scripts for evaluation.
